# Honor the stories that scared you.

Help fund this series of scary, cautionary tales from many different cultures.
A series of six designs featuring the *spookiest* folk we were told about as children in the form of **art prints and vinyl stickers.** I created a series of six designs of stories from around the world. They are all cousins in the same scary family... they want to be printed together as one project. And I need  your help. 
The project will take the form of:

* High quality vinyl stickers: 3x3"
* Numbered art prints: 5x7"
  
If all goes well, all six designs will rise from the land of our dark imaginations and enter this material plane!
