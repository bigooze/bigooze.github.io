My name is Ooze. I have a human legal name as well. This is my website. I'm an artist, designer, illustrator, writer, living in Phoenix. I don't have social media. Feel free to contact me at headlessmanhorse `[at]` g mail `[d0t]` c0m. 

You know, come to think of it, it'd be pretty cool if you sent me your favorite recipe. Just throwing that out there. I like cooking and maybe I'll try it out.
