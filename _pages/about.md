My name is Ooze. I have a human legal name as well. This is my website. I'm an artist, designer, illustrator, writer, living in Phoenix. I don't have social media. Feel free to contact me at headlessooze `[at]` protonmail `[d0t]` c0m. 

You know, come to think of it, it'd be pretty cool if you sent me your favorite recipe. Just throwing that out there. I like cooking and maybe I'll try it out.

I created this website using Jekyll, Github pages, and the theme "Minimal Mistakes." I've tried to customize the theme to my liking, and learn more about web design. This site is probably in perpetual construction; if you have any tips or book recommendations for learning web design, send them my way.
