## Feel free to hang out and look around.

Design, illustration, stickers, zines, writing, and any other project I get into my head. This website is a repository for essentially all of my creative work. **[Check out my etsy store, if you'd like!](https://www.etsy.com/shop/headlessmanhorse)** This is just a sampler of the work I do, and is not all-inclusive. I'm probably working on something I haven't posted yet...
