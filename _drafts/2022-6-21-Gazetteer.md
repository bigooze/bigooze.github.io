# note:
Here's a sample of the DM prep I did for a session. Note that I didn't finish prepping the scenario. There's a lot that can happen with improv.  

## The Mystery at Gazetteer continues...  

>*Tadmark sent cleric to cure the "terrible fungal infestation" - Gazetteer oddly abandoned - Old church stairwell explored, seems to go down forever - Man-faced giant crabs - Cottie eaten - Tadmarkian cleric's bodyguard caught by man-faced crab - Timothee said, "Listen, we lied"*
## 1
Dusk. Cold. Storm clouds are forming quickly on the horizon. The scene ended with the cleric on Gazetteer, alone, desperately grasping Timothee's clothes and begging for help. Timothee said, "Listen, we lied."

Adventurers must be reminded of what the hell they're actually pursuing; 
1. Long term goals: Prevent the Emperor of Tadmark from gaining so much power that he's able to storm the Astral Plane and become a god himself. 
   * Fleece asked them to gain favor from the other gods in order to stop Kee's favorite worshipper from assaulting the astral plane. 
   * Lusseg the god of rivers, toads and justice can be found in Mudpole. Stromm the god of craft and knowledge can be found in the far eastern mountains of the Sierra Condors. Fleece can be found anywhere. Kee can be found deep in the ocean beyond Gazetteer.
   * Gazetteer was destroyed by Kee because they mined relics out of her hoard of lost objects and thought they could get away with it. **Reflect this in the temple design**
2. **Immediate goals**: Three enemy ships who say they are a diplomatic envoy are sitting in the water outside of the magical island city. They want to speak to the **Chamber of Magicians** on behalf of Tadmark and they say they come bearing gifts. Their best cleric has just fainted in your arms after being attacked by a giant crab with a man's face. 
     * They don't know that the town has been abandoned, they don't know who you are but assume you are citizens of Gazetteer somehow (or maybe even members of the famous **Chamber of Magicians**) and they seem intimidated and cautious to land without permission. 
The cleric faints in Timothee's arms.

Tadmarkian ships saw that a giant crab had killed the cleric's bodyguard, and send fledgling over to apologize for the intrusion and that it won't happen again.
>*We deeply apologize for the intrusion and it will not happen again. We regret that one of our representatives apparently did not live up to the expectations of respect and demeanor that is required on the shores of Gazetteer. We fully agree with your decision to terminate her. Please send explicit confirmation before we take further action, and let us know if our cleric has also been terminated so that we can account for this loss of value.  
>Kee bless us all. End of mes--**sound of wood cracking**  Oh for fuck's sakes. Hey, was that the dragon? Have you fed the dragon yet? Oh, good. (*mumble mumble*) I don't know, something doesn't seem right. Our ships should have been destroyed by now if that were the case. (*mumble mumble*) Well I don't care if she's disloyal to the nation, she's the best cleric on the continent.  The bird? No it's fine, I've already ended the message. I never forget to end the message.*

*Atmosphere:* Night falls. It gets very cold as the many orb lights hover all around Gazetteer. Lots of small crabs start to follow whoever holds the necklace, and they try to take it and bring it down into to Kee's underwater temple. Storm is brewing, atmosphere changes, winds pick up, rain begins to fall, ice cold. All of the refugees seek shelter inside.  
:warning: Perception check  
:eye: Perception 10: You hear someone's voice calling for help outside the wall.  
:eye: Perception 15: you think it's Cottie's voice.  
:eye:Perception 20: Five big crabs are coming out of the water and headed toward the apartment building.
