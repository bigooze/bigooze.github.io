# Scratch
His name was Fel, and he was my friend. One time we were joyriding in Honey's stepdad's car because he always kept the keys on the passenger seat and the windows down. We ran up and hopped in and fired up the sedan, and I was driving, we fishtailed out onto the street, and Fel turns to look behind us and discovered that Honey's stepdad was still drunk in the backseat.
