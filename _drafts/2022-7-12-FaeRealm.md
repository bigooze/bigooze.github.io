## Recap
*Entered the fae realm - fairy juice changed people's forms over and over - met the three little pigs - faced the big bad wolf - helped build the three little pigs' new house - the wolf came and blew it all down - the players head south - xanax got a magic 8-ball*
* To get fairy juice, one must kill and drain the essence of a powerful fairy. The more powerful the fairy, the more juice you get. Run of the mill fairies only give a little. Powerful fairies give full drops.
* A day in the fae realm feels like 12 hours

## In Transit
They are on the man-bus traveling over a great pink grassland of rolling hills, and the man-bus gets tired and needs a break at the end of the night. They are out in the wide open, with no end of the hills in sight.

They can rest and ask questions to the gods:

>Visit from the Gods
>The family meeting continues. Stromm and Lusseg send a message. Knowing that reaching the gods during a meeting would be difficult, Gorstag and Bog must work together to do an augury.
>* Lusseg says to bring the criminal wizard to justice (that's all)
>* Stromm gives plans on how to build a fairy catching net: A Fairy Crown, a magic wand, and a spool of spider's silk. Stromm says to protect the lollipop at all costs, and never let anyone steal it, so that when you return to the fae realm, you can return it to its rightful place.

Going over the pink hills, the manbus begins to get tired. Soon, they see a single big mushroom. The Manbus immediately wants to go eat it.
Giant mushroom is white with purple splotches and lines on the cap. It's the size of a medium sized creature, about 6 feet tall.
* inspection of mushroom finds a secret door 
* all those who eat it make a constitution saving throw or are poisoned. If manbus eats it, it expells everyone out the backdoor and is completely stoned and can move no longer. "I can see colors that can't be seen, do you see them? By the gods the colors..." 
* they can leave the manbus there and say goodbye, and advance onward to the next town, or
* they can guard the bus until he sobers up. If they guard him, thieves come by and hijack them in the middle of the night Mad-Max fairy style
  * They're all Harendon bunny folk, led by a big white rabbit with a red vest and monocle
  * Pumpkin carriage covered in black thorns with a cannon turret on top. some have eyepatches and they're wearing armor made from curls of cinnamon bark
  * they're willing to trade a fairy in a bag for the man-bus because they're trying to win the race

## In Town
Duchess Kringle hosts the annual carriage race every year. The Race must have a carriage, at least one driver, and it must be drawn by a biological terrestrial animal of nonmagical locomotion. The winner gets a cauldron of gold coins, or one wish. 

When they're resting in the middle of the night, near or in the man-bus, they hear giggling, hear a count down. "10, 9, 8..." and witness fairies laughing as they feed the man-bus rotten looking cupcakes. Everyone gets blasted out of the back-flap in a huge explosion of green gas, and with an incredible rumbling, the man-bus starts to lift off.



### Skill test
* accumulate x successes before three failures
* I tell them which (multiple) skills will be useful in those challenges
* Only people who are proficient in those named skills can attempt the skill check. Once you've made an attempt with one skill, you can't use that skill again
* each success gets them closer to the goal, each failure gets them further away
* 

## Here is a header 2 for whatever it is

And here's where I'd put a picture of an alien or something.
