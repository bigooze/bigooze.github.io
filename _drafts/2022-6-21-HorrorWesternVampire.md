# The Way Down
Alongside the rattling wagon, Joy looked down and measured her footwork to overstep the worst of the stones, watching the wide floor of the earth pass under her feet, mind forgotting she was walking. She focused on every next step, and was not able to see what would become of her at their destination beyond the sunset.  

Her head became one with the weight of a widebrimmed hat under the heavy sun. The tall sharp grass was pillowsoft to step on. Better than the pointed rocks. The lowing of the ox, ambling huge and casual. Long days of perpetual flies led her eyes to butchered oxen carcasses beyond the road. It must have been a family that killed it because they led the creature around a hill, finding a private place for the killing, betraying their shame in the act for future passersby.  

*I couldn't do it, if she had to. No, of course I could*.  

She wondered what the ox thought. If it could recognize Death by the scent of fallen kin, like we do. The ox's tail simply whipped at flies. *To be harnessed like that.*  

The whole while, her grandmother reclined, bounced around in the linens, jangling lantern over her head. Joy heard the frogcall of her grandmother, a groan at each jostle and bump in the trail. *To be as naive as an ox. Walk, eat, sleep. Harnessed.*  

Her father became stone.
