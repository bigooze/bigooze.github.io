## Getting sent to print

I am going to do a full write-up of the kickstarter experience from the creator's perspective. But in the meantime, this is an update to let folks know that things are in motion, stickers are sent to print, and I'm working with the art print company to ensure everything comes out right.

That said, I need to work on my signature so I can sign all of these pieces! I'm dissatisfied with it in general, and this is after previously developing it. It certainly makes signing my ballots shady.

Peace!
