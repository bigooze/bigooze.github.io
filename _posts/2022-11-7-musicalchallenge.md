# THE PLAYLIST CHALLENGE
Have your friends make you a playlist of audio recordings with no limits or constraints that totals 31 tracks. No genre constraints. No time constraints. Any songs or recordings. 31 of them.
## Step 1: MAKE THE PLAYLIST
Maybe it's a shared playlist on a music streaming platform, or maybe you hassle your friends into giving you thirty one tracks. If you don't have any friends, find a way to develop 31 tracks of audio with a process that is **entirely out of your control**.
## Step 2: WRITE ONE FLASH FICTION OR SHORT PIECE ON, INSPIRED BY, OR DURING ONE SONG
It doesn't have to be 1:1 interpretation. But it has to be a completed piece. Once you've written a piece to a song, strike the song from the list.
## Step 3: REPEAT EVERY DAY FOR 31 DAYS
This is your new writing prompt challenge.

Find people. Force them to make you a playlist of 31 tracks of audio. Each day, write a flash fiction piece to one track.
