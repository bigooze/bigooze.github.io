# Insp0
We go to comicon aka Phoenix Fan Fusion(is that what they're calling it now?) every year. This year I paid particular attention to the artistic vendors. Fancons seem like the perfect place to set up shop. Bonus points because I happen to love them. 
What defines a successful one? Is it comparable to Phoenix Zine Fest, but scaled way up? The best looking booths had huge setups, backdrops, professional tableclothes and banners. I literally missed certain vendors because they just looked like a person seated between two "more serious" vendors. 
One of the things I appreciated about con was seeing how artists leveraged individual personal styles. When they're able to stay true to their own developed sense of artistic self, and all of their work fell into the same family, it was satisfying. My art is varied. I alternate between clean vector graphics and sketchy naturalistic art. But when you saw something by SprinkleBat, you knew it was SprinkleBat. Or you could navigate to "that one artist who makes the really cool busy loud designs". Very few of them had ten different styles. If I'm going to take Headless Rodeo more seriously, I need to think seriously about my own individual style, my own fingerprint.

## Who Am I?

Let's think about "Creepycute", the Haunted Mansion, Scooby Doo brand of horror that people love. I am a fan of creepycute. I buy many things that fall into this umbrella. I make horror stuff. Of the stickers that people respond the most to, I think the designs that people like are creepycute. But I'm not sure if that's really who I am. I *can* do it. It seems to make people happy. But is it what I enjoy doing? I set out with HR to really only do what I felt like doing. Chase what I enjoyed drawing. I think there's an element of "if you build it, they will come" to my thinking. 

The workflow of the iPad has significantly impacted my personal drawing. I simply can't draw like I'm used to. I can't pull clean ink lines the same way, using my whole body, with the haptic feedback of the paper tooth, with the drawing surface, with the pen, etc. And I sincerely dislike the stroke correction in drawing apps. Something feels icky about it. What's more, I'm not exactly a "clean lines" style person. I like a distressed, scratchy, sketchy thing. 

>I should attempt to make creepycute things using my own sense of style. 

## What next?
I've done a series of designs that I'd like to release as a set. Once I finish Krampus, I'll be done with the first run. I'm thinking of doing a kickstarter to fund printing costs, and potentially research art prints or postcards. I think it'd look great as a set. I got all of the business cards of the different vendors at con and I've followed them, but I'm thinking of reaching out to discuss the deets and logistics of doing something like that. Or just to get deets and logistics of doing vendor halls in general. I need to do more drawings that exemplify my personal identity, the lively, loud crunchy drawing style.
